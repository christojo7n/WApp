Wound Management using Deep Learning

#Abstract
Wound care is a Major issue that requires attention and valuable input. All though not a severe case compared to many issue. The Severity can be widespread. Wounds can be easily managed by being aware of basic treatments, faster respones and monitoring. General wound class such a Abrassion, Cut/Incision, Infected, Burn and Hematoma are those occur in daily life. A web application that is made using streamlit package and integrated with A Deep learning model will allow user to easily identify and deal with wounds, accurately and efficiently. The DL model is a small and efficient CNN. The model achieved an accuracy of 66.6% on very small data set of 1000 Image (200 images per class).
